     * KS Torn Hustling Advisor PC v0.1.6 — STATUS: CANDIDATE
     *
     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     * CHANGELOG
     *
     * 0.1.6
     *
     *   FIXED
     *     - Nothing. No defect was reported against 0.1.5 and none was looked for.
     *
     *   ADDED
     *     - ATTENTION_FLOOR = 40, the lower bound of the same community attention
     *       band ATTENTION_THRESHOLD already implements (prior art file, section
     *       2.5). Two independent sources — Emforu's in-depth guide and
     *       torn-intel's guide — describe Lose until attention clears 60, then Win
     *       until it falls back to around 40, then Lose again. Only the upper
     *       bound existed before this release, so the advisor returned to LOSE
     *       the moment a single Win halved attention back under 60 — the
     *       community rhythm never ran past one Win per cycle.
     *     - A small phase memory, `phase`, holding 'BUILD' or 'HARVEST'. Attention
     *       45 means "not yet" on the way up from a Lose and "keep going" on the
     *       way down from a Win, so the two bounds cannot be told apart without
     *       remembering which side of the cycle the advisor is on. It is a plain
     *       variable in this file's own module scope — no localStorage, no
     *       sessionStorage, no cookie, no GM_setValue, nothing that survives a
     *       page reload. It starts at 'BUILD' when the script is first evaluated,
     *       resets to 'BUILD' again whenever the panel (re)mounts and whenever
     *       there is no betting audience member, and is otherwise read or written
     *       only inside decideOnActiveBet — never by a warning, the cash check,
     *       the ranking or the panel — and it is never rendered.
     *     - Two new recommendation lines in decideOnActiveBet for the HARVEST
     *       phase: "Attention N is still above the 40 community floor. Keep
     *       winning while the audience holds." and "Attention N has fallen below
     *       the 40 community floor. Lose rebuilds the audience before the next
     *       win."
     *
     *   CHANGED
     *     - decideOnActiveBet's dual-enabled branch (both Win and Lose available,
     *       attention readable) now compares the lowest bettor's attention against
     *       ATTENTION_THRESHOLD while in BUILD and against ATTENTION_FLOOR while
     *       in HARVEST, instead of always against ATTENTION_THRESHOLD. The other
     *       three branches in that function — Win-only enabled, Lose-only
     *       enabled, and unreadable attention — are byte-for-byte unchanged and
     *       never touch `phase`.
     *     - The footer now reads "Attention thresholds 60 and 40 are a community
     *       heuristic." in place of the single-threshold sentence.
     *     - RETRACTED: the ATTENTION_THRESHOLD comment's earlier claim that the
     *       cycle "emerges on its own" from a single threshold, with no phase
     *       memory needed. That held only in the absence of a lower bound; with
     *       ATTENTION_FLOOR in play the phase has to be remembered after all.
     *       A companion claim in the status file, that this change would be "a
     *       constant and a branch", is retracted for the same reason — it is a
     *       constant, a small fixed phase and four branches.
     *
     *   KNOWN ISSUES
     *     - Every 0.1.5 known issue below still stands. In particular, the
     *       doubling model behind CASH_WARNING_RATIO's "About N more losses"
     *       wording is still a rough estimate, not a model — unchanged by this
     *       release.
     *     - The audience-summary parsing bug is measured but deliberately NOT
     *       fixed here. Torn now writes an inserted clause —
     *       "N people, M bets including K favorite(s), $X in total" — which
     *       parseAudienceSummary's pattern does not match, so the panel prints a
     *       false "could not be read" warning. It never changes a recommendation
     *       or a number, since summary.bets/totalBet/confidence are not read
     *       anywhere in this file and memberCount already falls back to the
     *       counted members. It belongs to v0.1.7 so this release keeps its one
     *       change.
     *
     *   VERIFICATION
     *     - NOT runtime-verified yet. Status stays CANDIDATE until the owner has
     *       run it on a live Hustling page and watched a Win land while HARVEST
     *       holds attention above 40, and a Lose follow once it falls below 40.
     *
     * 0.1.5
     *
     *   FIXED
     *     - Nothing. No defect was reported against 0.1.4 and none was looked for.
     *
     *   ADDED
     *     - @downloadURL and @updateURL, pointing at this file's raw URL on the
     *       main branch, so Tampermonkey can offer and apply updates once this
     *       file is published there. Same two lines, same placement directly
     *       after @version, as KS_FFScouter_Call_Guard.user.js already uses on
     *       main — no new publishing convention was invented for this script.
     *
     *   CHANGED
     *     - Nothing else. This is a publishing-metadata-only release: no
     *       decision logic, no adapter, no CSS, no panel text, no threshold,
     *       no constant besides @version and VERSION, and no @grant. Still
     *       @grant none, still no @connect, still zero network calls.
     *
     *   KNOWN ISSUES
     *     - Every 0.1.4 known issue below still stands unchanged. None of them
     *       is a metadata matter and this release neither fixes nor worsens
     *       any of them.
     *
     *   VERIFICATION
     *     - NOT runtime-verified yet. This release only adds update-channel
     *       metadata; Tampermonkey does not evaluate @downloadURL/@updateURL
     *       while a script is already installed and running, so the 0.1.4
     *       runtime verification below still describes this script's actual
     *       behaviour in the browser. What is unverified is the update path
     *       itself: that Tampermonkey can find and apply this file for a
     *       fresh or existing install once it is live on main.
     *
     * 0.1.4
     *
     *   FIXED
     *     - Nothing. No defect was reported against 0.1.3 and none was looked for.
     *
     *   ADDED
     *     - The KS UI theme, spec v1 (KS_UI-tema_spec_v1_2026-09-08.txt), applied to
     *       this panel as the suite pilot. The full --ks-* token list is declared on
     *       :host at the top of PANEL_STYLES and is identical to the block that will
     *       go into the other seven scripts. Tokens sit on :host and not on :root,
     *       because :root does not exist inside a shadow root.
     *     - Three purely visual elements inside the panel's own shadow root: a 26 x 26
     *       px flat KS mark in the header, a 10 px sub-line under the script name
     *       giving the suite, the platform and the version, and one hairline divider
     *       with a rotated 5 px square between the header and the body. None of the
     *       three carries data, listens for events or touches Torn's DOM.
     *     - The two header markers are now .ksui-pill: CANDIDATE as .unknown, MAX CE
     *       + CS as .ident. The constants themselves are unchanged — this is a change
     *       of appearance, not of status.
     *     - font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums on .verb and .cost, so the nerve figure
     *       cannot make the recommendation line jump width when it changes.
     *
     *   CHANGED
     *     - This release is a pure theme change. No logic was touched: no threshold,
     *       no ranking, no ATTENTION_THRESHOLD, no CASH_WARNING_RATIO, no calculation,
     *       no selector against Torn's DOM, no data model, no lifecycle, no observer,
     *       no polling or debounce interval, no storage key, and no metadata line
     *       other than @version. Every changed line lives in PANEL_STYLES, buildPanel,
     *       renderPaused, renderRecommendation, this changelog, the metadata @version
     *       or the VERSION constant.
     *     - The purple accent (#7a5cff) and the purple script name (#b7a6ff) are gone,
     *       replaced by gold per the theme's base rule: gold is frame and identity,
     *       never data. All thirteen raw colour values in the stylesheet are gone. The
     *       only raw values left are the two black stops of the header gradient and
     *       the black channel of the double frame, which the spec counts as parts of
     *       the frame rather than as colour choices.
     *     - The footer's compliance notice is character-identical to 0.1.3. Only its
     *       formatting changed: 11 px, --ks-muted, hairline rule above it.
     *     - The panel keeps no forced declarations at all. Torn's CSS cannot reach
     *       into the panel's shadow root, so none is needed and none was added.
     *
     *   KNOWN ISSUES
     *     - Every 0.1.3 known issue below still stands unchanged. None of them is a
     *       display matter and the theme neither fixes nor worsens any of them.
     *     - .cost is set in --ks-text, not --ks-muted as the build brief's class table
     *       said. The brief's own acceptance test, point 7, requires the nerve figure
     *       to read near-white, and the spec's base rule puts any value read for a
     *       decision in --ks-text. Those two agree with each other and not with that
     *       one table row, so the table row lost. Say the word and it flips.
     *     - The divider's hairline does not fade out towards the edges. A fade needs a
     *       second gradient and the spec allows exactly one gradient per panel, in the
     *       header. The line is inset from both edges instead, which reads much the
     *       same and costs nothing.
     *     - The frame's inner line uses color-mix() for gold at 42 % opacity, so that
     *       no fourth gold value has to be invented outside the token list. color-mix
     *       needs Chrome 111 or newer. If it is missing, that one border falls back to
     *       the element's text colour; the outer gold line and everything else stand.
     *
     *   VERIFICATION
     *     - NOT runtime-verified. Waiting on Kingshade's PC test. Status stays
     *       CANDIDATE until all ten acceptance points below come back green.
     *     - node --check on the published file: green.
     *     - Diffed against 0.1.3: no changed line outside PANEL_STYLES, buildPanel,
     *       renderPaused, renderRecommendation, the metadata block's @version, the
     *       VERSION constant and this changelog.
     *     - Footer text compared character by character against 0.1.3: identical.
     *     - Forced-declaration count (the CSS importance flag): zero before, zero after.
     *
     *     ACCEPTANCE TEST — PC, run by Kingshade
     *       1. Open Chrome.
     *       2. Go to torn.com and log in as usual.
     *       3. Click Crimes in the left menu.
     *       4. Click Hustling.
     *       5. Look at the panel that starts with the text KS HUSTLING ADVISOR. It
     *          should have a thin double gold frame around it and a small square KS
     *          mark at the top left.
     *       6. The heading beside the KS mark should be in gold capitals.
     *       7. The recommendation, for example GATHER — Audience, should be green. The
     *          nerve figure beside it should be near-white, not gold.
     *       8. Below the header row there should be a thin gold line with a small
     *          diamond in the middle. Exactly one such line in the whole panel.
     *       9. At the bottom of the panel, the text about the script only reading the
     *          page and making no network calls should still be there.
     *      10. Scroll the page up and down. The panel must not stutter or flicker.
     *
     *     All ten green: the pilot is VERIFIED for PC, and the CSS block is proven in
     *     real runtime before it goes on to the next script.
     *
     * 0.1.3
     *
     *   FIXED
     *     - The advisor no longer walks the player into an empty wallet without
     *       saying anything. Torn's wiki states that raising a game's Technique
     *       raises the audience's betting values, and Technique rises on every Win
     *       and Lose — so following this advisor's own advice drives the stake up.
     *       The owner's measured series on one Snail Racing row ran $1,102 ->
     *       $2,238 -> $5,190 -> $8,106 and then the money was gone. Up to 0.1.2 the
     *       advisor read neither the balance nor Technique and could not see it
     *       coming; the only signal was Torn blocking the button afterwards, which
     *       0.1.2 reports but which arrives too late to act on.
     *
     *   ADDED
     *     - The player's cash is read from Torn's own sidebar: the unhashed
     *       id="user-money", whose data-money attribute carries the amount as a
     *       plain integer. Present exactly once in all eleven captures from
     *       2026-08-28 and 2026-09-08. The rendered text is a normalised fallback.
     *     - A warning whenever a live bet is CASH_WARNING_RATIO of the balance or
     *       more, naming the game, the stake, the balance and how many further
     *       losses the balance can absorb. It is raised whatever action ends up
     *       being recommended, because it describes the table and not the advice.
     *       It sits after the blocked-bet warning and before the attention one.
     *     - A fail-closed notice when the balance cannot be read at all, so an
     *       unreadable balance is never silently taken for a healthy one.
     *
     *   CHANGED
     *     - Nothing in the recommendation logic. The action ranking, the attention
     *       threshold and the blocked-bet warning are all untouched.
     *     - readState now takes an optional document, defaulting to the root's own,
     *       so the sidebar read stays in the adapter layer and is testable.
     *
     *   KNOWN ISSUES
     *     - CASH_WARNING_RATIO = 0.2 is a DERIVED SAFETY MARGIN from the owner's
     *       own measured stake series, not a Torn-verified figure — the same
     *       standing as ATTENTION_THRESHOLD.
     *     - "Roughly doubles per loss" is that same measured series, not a
     *       published rule. The count of affordable losses follows from it and is
     *       an estimate, not a guarantee.
     *     - Technique itself is still not read, so the advisor cannot say how fast
     *       the stake will climb from here — only where it stands now.
     *     - The balance is read at render time only. A balance that changes while
     *       nothing on the Hustling board changes is not noticed until the next
     *       board update. That is deliberate: no polling, no extra observer.
     *     - The attention ceiling (attention + suspicion = 100) is still not used.
     *     - Still no suspicion logic, still no lower attention bound of 40, and
     *       CRITICAL FAILURE's outcome class is still unobserved.
     *
     *   VERIFICATION
     *     - Vitest: full suite green against the real published file.
     *     - ESLint, Prettier, tsc, node --check, suite validator: green.
     *     - KS compliance-syntax gate on this file: zero hits, unchanged from 0.1.2.
     *     - Playwright: NOT green and not touched — a pre-existing War Dibs
     *       harness mismatch fails the whole browser suite.
     *     - Real Torn PC runtime: NOT verified for 0.1.3. Status is CANDIDATE.
     *
     * 0.1.2  (runtime-verified on PC 2026-09-08, no-money case)
     *
     *   FIXED
     *     - A blocked bet no longer disappears from the state.
     *       Torn overwrites a blocked button's aria-label with the block reason,
     *       so once Lose and Win were both blocked the adapter lost every trace
     *       of the bet, reported hasActiveBet: false, fell back to
     *       AUDIENCE_NO_BET and advised Demo as though nothing had happened.
     *       Caught in runtime on 2026-09-08 09:27:34: a $5,190 bet stood on
     *       Snail Racing against a $248 balance, both buttons read "You're not
     *       carrying enough money", and the panel said "DEMO — Cornhole,
     *       confidence low" without mentioning the bet at all. The same gap
     *       existed for nerve, with $4,328 standing behind "You don't have
     *       enough nerve".
     *       The row's bet state is now read in this order: an enabled Lose or
     *       Win means an actionable bet; otherwise a betAmount above zero beside
     *       a blocked commit button means the bet is live but out of reach;
     *       otherwise there is no bet. The amount is the primary signal — the
     *       hashed `dim` class on an empty "$0" is never read on its own.
     *
     *   ADDED
     *     - A warning, first in the list, naming the game, the amount and Torn's
     *       own reason verbatim:
     *         Snail Racing has an active $5,190 bet you cannot act on:
     *         "You're not carrying enough money"
     *     - A betAmount element that is present but unparsable now makes the row
     *       unknown rather than "no bet". Nothing on such a row is recommended,
     *       and a warning says so.
     *
     *   CHANGED
     *     - Confidence drops one step (high->medium, medium->low, low stays low)
     *       while a blocked bet is on the board, because that is not the
     *       situation this mode optimises for. The all-blocked HOLD is exempt and
     *       is unchanged: Torn itself is the source there, so it stays 'high'.
     *     - The recommendation itself is NOT forced to HOLD. If Demo or Gather
     *       are still possible they are still advised, because they still earn
     *       skill. Only the existing all-blocked case yields HOLD.
     *
     *   KNOWN ISSUES
     *     - The advisor does not read the player's balance. It sits outside
     *       hustling-root and would need a new DOM surface and a third observer,
     *       so there is no warning BEFORE the block hits — only after, in Torn's
     *       own words. A forewarning is a later version.
     *     - The attention ceiling (attention + suspicion = 100, measured across
     *       the 2026-09-08 captures) is not used yet. A member whose suspicion is
     *       above 40 can never reach the threshold of 60 again, and the panel
     *       cannot say so.
     *     - Still no suspicion logic. The "Suspicion is above 0" warning is
     *       carried over verbatim.
     *     - The lower bound of 40 from the community band is still not
     *       implemented; only the upper bound of 60 exists.
     *     - CRITICAL FAILURE's outcome class is still unobserved.
     *
     *   VERIFICATION
     *     - Vitest: full suite green against the real published file.
     *     - ESLint, Prettier, tsc, node --check, suite validator: green.
     *     - KS compliance-syntax gate on this file: zero hits.
     *     - Playwright: NOT green and not touched — a pre-existing War Dibs
     *       harness mismatch fails the whole browser suite.
     *     - Real Torn PC runtime, no-money case: VERIFIED on PC 2026-09-08. With
     *       a $248 balance against a $256 bet on Snail Racing and both buttons
     *       blocked, the panel read "Snail Racing has an active $256 bet you
     *       cannot act on: \"You're not carrying enough money\"". 0.1.1 reported
     *       hasActiveBet: false on the same board and said nothing about the bet.
     *     - The no-nerve case and the case where Torn blocks without stating a
     *       reason run through the same code path, but neither has been observed
     *       in live runtime. Both are covered by tests only.
     *
     * 0.1.1  (runtime-verified on PC 2026-09-08)
     *
     *   FIXED
     *     - Nothing. No defect was reported against 0.1.0-alpha.1.
     *
     *   ADDED
     *     - Nothing. This release carries a single behavioural change and no
     *       new feature, constant, observer, warning or DOM read.
     *
     *   CHANGED
     *     - ATTENTION_THRESHOLD moves from 50 to 60.
     *       Two independent community sources describe a PAIR of thresholds
     *       rather than one: build attention up above 60, take it back down to
     *       around 40, repeat. Emforu's Torn-hosted in-depth guide gives
     *       "Lose until someone's attention is maxed or overall attention is
     *       over 60% / Win until attention is around 40%, then lose", and
     *       torn-intel's Hustling guide gives the same 60/40 pair independently.
     *       A single threshold sitting in the middle of that band made the
     *       advice flip-flop around 50 instead of running the cycle. With the
     *       upper bound at 60 the cycle emerges on its own — a Win lowers
     *       attention, a Lose raises it — so the script still needs no memory of
     *       which phase it is in, and still stores nothing.
     *       Concretely: a betting audience at attention 53 now reads LOSE where
     *       0.1.0-alpha.1 read WIN. At 65 it still reads WIN, unchanged.
     *     - options.attentionThreshold in decide() is unchanged and still
     *       overrides the default.
     *
     *   KNOWN ISSUES
     *     - 60 is a COMMUNITY HEURISTIC. It is not Torn-verified, and the panel
     *       must never present it as a verified line. It is stated as community
     *       data in the panel footer.
     *     - The lower bound of 40, from the same two sources, is NOT implemented
     *       in this version. Only the upper bound exists, so the script advises
     *       Lose all the way down to 0 rather than stopping at 40.
     *     - No suspicion logic. The existing "Suspicion is above 0" warning is
     *       carried over verbatim and its wording is known to be due for review.
     *     - CRITICAL FAILURE's outcome class is still unobserved and still
     *       treated as an unknown outcome.
     *
     *   VERIFICATION
     *     - Vitest: full suite green against the real published file and the
     *       sanitised PC capture fixtures.
     *     - ESLint, Prettier, tsc, node --check, suite validator: green.
     *     - KS compliance-syntax gate on this file: zero hits.
     *     - Playwright: NOT green, and not touched by this release. The whole
     *       browser suite fails on a pre-existing War Dibs harness mismatch.
     *     - Real Torn PC runtime: NOT verified. Status stays CANDIDATE until
     *       the owner has run it on a live Hustling page.
     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * One feature, nothing else: read the Hustling view the player is actually
     * looking at and show exactly one recommended next MANUAL action, its nerve
     * cost, a short reason and the warnings that follow from visible data.
     *
     * Disclosure (KS baseline rule 10 — no undocumented functionality):
     *   - Network calls: none. No fetch, no XHR, no WebSocket, no GM_* transport,
     *     no @connect host, no Torn API, no API key is read, asked for or stored.
     *   - Storage: none. No localStorage, no sessionStorage, no cookies, no logs.
     *     The minimise state lives in memory for the lifetime of the page only.
     *   - Data leaving the page: none. Nothing is collected, exported or shared.
     *   - Gameplay: none. The script never clicks, submits, navigates, scrolls,
     *     dispatches events at Torn's DOM or injects an iframe. Every real action
     *     is performed by the player on Torn's own control.
     *   - Reading scope: the subtree under div.crime-root.hustling-root on the page
     *     the player has manually opened, and only while that page is visible and
     *     focused. Observation is disconnected when it is not.
     *
     * Uncertainty that the panel must never present as fact:
     *   - Exact CE per Hustling action is unknown. No CE number is ever displayed.
     *   - The CS-per-nerve ranking used as a tie-break is community data, not Torn.
     *   - The attention threshold is a community heuristic, not a Torn-verified line.
     *   - Suspicion was 0 in every capture the DOM contract was read from. The scale
     *     is assumed, never presented as verified.
     *   - CRITICAL FAILURE's outcome class has never been observed. Any outcome class
     *     that is neither success nor failure is treated as an unknown outcome.
     *
     * Platform: PC / Tampermonkey. Torn PDA is deliberately NOT supported by this
     * file — no Hustling capture from PDA exists, so its DOM would be guesswork.
